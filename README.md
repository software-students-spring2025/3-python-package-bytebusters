## Development set up

1. Install Python (3.11+), pipenv, and Git.
2. Navigate to the project folder, start a virtual environment `python -m venv venv`, and activate it by `source venv/bin/activate ` for mac and `venv\Scripts\activate` for windows.
3. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the package using commands below.

## Running the package in terminal

- Example commands for text to morse: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m morse --text "HELLO WORLD"`
- Example commands for morse to text: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m morse --morse ".... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -.."`
- Example commands for text input file to morse output file: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m morse --input_file input.txt --output_file output.txt --file_mode text_to_morse`
- Example commands for morse input file to text output file: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m morse --input_file input.txt --output_file output.txt --file_mode morse_to_text`
- Example commands for including a sound output: `PYTHONPATH=src python -m morse --text "HELLO WORLD" --sound`
