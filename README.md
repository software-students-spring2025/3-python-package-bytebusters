# Morse Code Package Example

This package was created by generally following the [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) guidelines, with the addition of some [pipenv setup](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/managing-dependencies/) to manage virtual environments.

## How this package was created

1. [Install pipenv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/managing-dependencies/#managing-dependencies), [build](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives), and [twine](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#twine) if not already installed.
2. Create a directory structure for the package similar to what is shown below, where `morsecodepackage` (or another unique name) is replaced with your package’s name. This name must be uniquely yours when uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). It’s generally better to avoid hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) in the package name, as these can create problems when importing. The parent directory name (the repository name) is not relevant to the package name.

3. Make `__init__.py` an empty file (or minimally define what you need there).
4. Enter the text of a [copyright license of your choosing](https://choosealicense.com/) into `LICENSE`.
5. Add settings in `pyproject.toml` suitable for a `setuptools`-based build (or another build backend if you prefer) and add metadata fields to this file. See examples in official packaging guides or in other repositories for reference.
6. Put your own custom module code into `src/morsecodepackage/`, e.g. `file_converter.py`, `message_generator.py`, `morse_code_converter.py`, or whatever filenames and modules you prefer.
7. Optionally add a `__main__.py` file to the package directory if you want to be able to run the package as a script from the command line, e.g. `python -m morsecodepackage`.
8. Build the project by running:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```
   from the same directory where the `pyproject.toml` file is located.
9. Verify that the built `.tar.gz` archive has the files you expect your package to have (including any important non-code files) by running a command like:
   ```bash
   tar --list -f dist/morsecodepackage-0.0.1.tar.gz
   ```
   (Replace `morsecodepackage-0.0.1` with your own package name and version.)
10. Create an account on [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) so that you can upload to a test repository instead of the production PyPI repo.
11. Create a [new API token](https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens) on TestPyPI with the “Scope” set to “Entire account” and save a copy of it somewhere safe.
12. [Upload your package](morsecodepackage) to the TestPyPI repository using twine, e.g.:
    ```bash
    twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
    ```
13. Twine will output the URL of your package on the TestPyPI website. Load that URL in your web browser to see your published package. Check that the `README.md` looks correct on the site.

Every time you change the code in your package, you need to rebuild and reupload it to PyPI (or TestPyPI). You must build from a clean state and update the version number:

1. Delete the autogenerated `dist` directory.
2. Delete the autogenerated `src/*.egg-info` directory.
3. Update the version number in `pyproject.toml` and anywhere else it appears.
4. Build the package again with:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```
5. Upload the package again with:
   ```bash
   twine upload -r testpypi dist/*
   ```

Repeat as needed until your package works as expected.

If updating version numbers frequently becomes tedious, you may consider using [bumpver](https://pypi.org/project/bumpver/#configuration-setup), which can automate some parts of updating version numbers.

**When you are ready, upload to the real PyPI** instead of TestPyPI.

## How to install and use this package

Try [installing and using your package](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#installing-your-newly-uploaded-package) in a separate Python project:

1. Create a `pipenv`-managed virtual environment and install the latest version of your package:
   ```bash
   pipenv install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ morsecodepackage==0.0.1
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```
3. Create a Python program file that imports your package and uses it.
4. Run that program:
   ```bash
   python my_program_file.py
   ```
5. Exit the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

## Continuous Integration

This project has a Continuous Integration (CI) workflow under `.github/workflows`. It automatically:

- Installs dependencies
- Builds the package
- Runs unit tests

every time you push code to GitHub. You can customize this workflow to suit additional needs like code coverage reports, deployment steps, etc.
